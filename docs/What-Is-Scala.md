# What is Scala?

[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level
language. Scala's static types help avoid bugs in complex applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you
build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.

## What is functional programming?
In functional programming, functions are what we call _first-class citizens_. This means that functions are passed as
objects just like integers and arrays. Functions may have functions as parameters and return values, like an other data
type.
We generally contrast functional programming with object oriented programming or imperative programming. In imperative
programming, we use for loops to access all the elements of an array. Itâ€™s typical in imperative programming to modify
the elements of an array. In functional programming, we will use functions like _map_ to access every element of a collection,
and rather than modifying the collection, we create a new one. The functional style, while it can take a little to get used to,
can lead to cleaner more concise code.

* functions has first class data types
* Using immutable data and _maps_ instead of looing and data mutation.

## Compatible with Java

Since Scala is a JVM language, it compiles to Java bytecode, and can just use standard Java libraries.  This is similar
to [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/)

## What most people use Scala For

Popular enterprise frameworks like [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.1/scala-programming-guide.html), 
[Akka](https://akka.io/) and [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) were written in Scala.  Many scala developers work
on building apps on top of these frameworks.
