# What is Scala?

[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level
language. Scala's static types help avoid bugs in complex applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you
build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.

## What is functional programming?


## Compatible with Java

Since Scala is a JVM language, it compiles to Java bytecode, and can just use standard Java libraries.  This is similar
to [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/)

## What most people use Scala For

Popular enterprise frameworks like [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.1/scala-programming-guide.html), 
[Akka](https://akka.io/) and [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) were written in Scala.  Many scala developers work
on building apps on top of these frameworks.
