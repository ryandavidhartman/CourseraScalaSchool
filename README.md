## Setup Your Machine:
In order to work on the programming assignments, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

* Oracle JDK, the Java Development Kit, version 1.8.

Check you have the right version by typing in the console:
`java -version`

* Scala Build Tool (sbt), a build tool for Scala, version 0.13.x, or newer.
The Scala IDE for Eclipse, Intellij IDEA or another IDE of your choice.
Please follow the instructions on this page carefully.

### Installing the JDK

If you don't have Java 8 or higher installed on your computer:
Install a recent build of the Java 8 Platform, such as OpenJDK or https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html.
Any Java 8 compliant runtime will do (but note that Oracle versions before 8u102 have a known issue that affects Scala).

### Installing sbt
Follow https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html  to download and install SBT. Once the installation is complete, verify the installation by running the following command in a terminal session:

`sbt sbtVersion`

[info] This is sbt 1.1.0
If the sbt command is not found, you need to install sbt.
