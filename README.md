Welcome to my little Scala School!  This started as my notes for classes I taught at Angie's List, and now has elements shamelessly stolen from the much better Scala School my new company Twitter has.

In any event this repo is not endorsed by or affliented with any company.  The mistakes are mine, the good parts are probably stolen.
