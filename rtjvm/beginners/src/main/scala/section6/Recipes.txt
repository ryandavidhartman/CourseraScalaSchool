This example is from "Programming in Scala" 4th Edition.
Chapter 29:  Modular Programming Using Objects

Interesting to note this was probably inspired by
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" 2nd Edition
Chapter 3: Modularity, Objects and State, especially section
3.5.5 Modularity of Functional Programs and Modularity of Objects
