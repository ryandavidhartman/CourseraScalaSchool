# The official repository for the Rock the JVM Scala at Light Speed course

This repository contains the code we wrote during  [Rock the JVM's Scala at Light Speed](https://rockthejvm.com/course/scala-at-light-speed) mini-course/video series. Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

## How to install

- if you don't have IntelliJ IDEA installed, install it from the [official site](https://jetbrains.com)
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project

### How to start

Clone this repository and checkout the `start` tag by running the following in the repo folder:

```
git checkout start
```

### How to see the final code

The master branch contains the final code, so you can download the repository as is, or if you've navigated somewhere in the code history, then do

```
git checkout master
```

### How to run an intermediate state

The repository was built while recording the videos. Prior to each video, I tagged each commit so you can easily go back to an earlier state of the repo!

The tags are as follows:

* `start`
* `basics`
* `object-orientation`
* `functional-programming`
* `pattern-matching`
* `advanced`

When you watch a video, you can `git checkout` the appropriate tag and the repo will go back to the exact code I had when I started the lecture.

### For questions or suggestions

If you have changes to suggest to this repo, either
- submit a GitHub issue
- tell me in the comments to the videos
- submit a pull request!
