Exercise 2.53

What would the interpreter print in response to evaluating each of the following expressions?

(list 'a 'b 'c)

(list (list 'george))
(cdr '((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))

(cadr '((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))
(pair? (car '(a short list)))
(memq 'red '((red shoes) (blue socks)))

(memq 'red '(red shoes blue socks))


Predictions:

(a b c)

((george))
(y1 y2)  => WRONG ((y1 y2)) is correct

y1 => WRONG (y1 y2) is correct
false
false

(shoes blue socks) => WRONG (red shoes blue socks)
